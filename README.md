# affine-overlay
Overlay of two images using an affine transformation of corresponding points

This program overlays/blends two images (or their contours) with each other.For this process first three (affine) or more points (perspective) have to be selected at the two images (note: the point order must match). With <space> you continue to the next view. At the end you see the result, if you want to redo: press <r>.
